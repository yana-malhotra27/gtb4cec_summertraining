    //encapsulation-(variable) Mechanism for Data Hiding (unauthorized access avoid) and abstraction
    //inheritance-creates relationship between two classes-parent(super class)<-- child relation (sub class) (is A) tight relationship and association relation-aggregation relation ; composite relation car has a engine example (Has A) weak relationship
    //arrow always up
    //in java, Every class inherit another class except object class root of the tree AND one class can only one another class nahi to diamond problem resolved from interface
    //type of inheritance-single level inheritance possible
    //multi level inheritance possible
    //multiple inheritance not in java
    //hierarichal possible
    //hybrid not in java
    //scope resolution in c++
    //cpu register other memory but 3 needed-class/method area, stack, heap
    //polymorphism-compile time polymorphism (overloading) and runtime polymorphism (overidng)
    //overloading- fn name same ; parameter diff-no. of para, type of para, order of para, return type doesn't matter
    //overiding- defining new defination- inheritance,parent class has fn same should have child class with same para,types,order with same return type
