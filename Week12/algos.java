    //bellman ford's algo -negative edge present path
    //prims-min spanning tree remove cycles all nodes are covered path that covers less cost
    //prims-priority queue
    //priority que more used in real world 1 close to death 5 still in danger 9 almost safe ascending or descending
    //dijkstra algo -sssp single source shortest path min cost path
    //problem in dijkstara so introduced bellman ford- ex in directed graph negative path
    //infinite loop problem when negative elements come in graph
    //-ve path then travel again negative so values get reduced so bellman ford came
    //he said if there's v vertex paths negative edges so run till v times
    //prims short sighted it sees children so doesn't see negative part
    //bellman ford lil tricky- v vertex in arraylist form till n vertices done
